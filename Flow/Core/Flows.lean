/-! # Flow Operators and Flows Typeclass

`DerivedFlow` defines a single derivation mechanism for constructing transformed flows.
`Flows` extends `DerivedFlow` and provides `map`, `filter`, `filterMap` with defaults
derived from `derive`, plus `combine`, `subscribe`, `flush`, `forEach`, and `toList`.
-/

/-- Construct a derived flow from a source, given a handler that processes
    each emission and decides what to emit downstream. -/
class DerivedFlow (f : Type → Type) where
  /-- Create a derived flow where each source emission is processed by a handler
      that receives an `emit` callback and the source value. -/
  derive : f α → ((β → IO Unit) → α → IO Unit) → IO (f β)

instance : MonadLiftT (Except ε) Option where
  monadLift
    | .ok a => some a
    | .error _ => none

private def defaultMap [DerivedFlow F] (flow : F α) (f : α → β) : IO (F β) :=
  DerivedFlow.derive flow fun emit a => emit (f a)

private def defaultFilter [DerivedFlow F] (flow : F α) (pred : α → Bool) : IO (F α) :=
  DerivedFlow.derive flow fun emit a => if pred a then emit a else pure ()

private def defaultFilterMap [DerivedFlow F] (flow : F α) (f : α → Option β) : IO (F β) :=
  DerivedFlow.derive flow fun emit a =>
    match f a with
    | some b => emit b
    | none => pure ()

/-- Typeclass for stream types that can be subscribed to.

    Parameterized by:
    - `F` : the flow type constructor
    - `M` : the monad for callbacks and flush (e.g. `IO`, `PredictableProgram ε`)
    - `V` : value wrapper passed to callbacks (e.g. `Id` for plain values, `Except ε` for error-aware)

    `M` and `V` are `outParam`s — inferred automatically from `F`.

    Extends `DerivedFlow F` — instances must provide `derive`, which enables default
    implementations for `map`, `filter`, and `filterMap`.

/-- Types whose values can be combined into one (e.g. config merging). -/
class Combinable (α : Type) where
  combine : α → α → α

/-- Three-way merge for concurrent state updates.
    `merge initial new existing` computes the delta `new - initial` and applies it to `existing`,
    so independent mutations from different callbacks compose correctly. -/
class MergeableState (α : Type) where
  merge (initial new existing : α) : α
  /-- Strip fields that participate in merging, giving a clean baseline for execution. -/
  withoutMergeable (initial : α) : α

/-- Bridge: run a Program action atomically using shared mutexes.

    Three-phase protocol:
    1. **Snapshot**: atomically read current state from the primary mutex
    2. **Execute**: run the program with a clean copy of the snapshot
       (non-mergeable fields stripped via `MergeableState.withoutMergeable`)
    3. **Merge**: atomically combine the program's new state into
       every mutex's current state via `MergeableState.merge`

    This ensures concurrent callbacks each contribute their own state
    changes without overwriting each other's updates. When multiple mutexes
    are provided (e.g. from combined flows), the delta is propagated to all.

    Called automatically by ProgramFlow subscribe
    callbacks for thread-safe state access across concurrent emissions.

    Returns the Except result without unwrapping it. -/
